Pigion
======

*Note:* I am practicing [README-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html). This README will serve as a general introduction to what this software will do when it is completed. This message will stay here until the software is in a usable state.

What is Pigion?
---------------

Pigion is a share anything app for Mac OSX + Heroku + S3.

Huh?
----

We share stuff with each other all day. 

Found a funny picture in your documents folder you haven't seen in ages and want to send it to Mom? 

Cmd + Shift + C puts a link to any file you have locally on your clipboard that you can then paste in an email or IM, iMessage, ChatRoulette window, or anywhere else your heart desires.

This is cool, but I would only use it if...
-------------------------------------------

###...I could password protect the files
>You can.

###...I could make the file available for only a short amount of time
>You can.

###...I could use my Dropbox instead of hosting it on my own S3
>You can.

###...I could use my Google Drive instead of hosting it on my own S3
>You can.

###...there was a quick way to generate a link to Rick Astly's Never Gonna Give You Up
>Go away.


Active development
------------------

As I stated before, this project is in active development. This README was the first thing I created. 

If this is the only file in the repo and the last commit was over 3 months ago, I probably abandoned it and forgot about it. Sorry.
