Pigion
======

*Note:* I am practicing [README-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html). This README will serve as a general introduction to what this software will do when it is completed. This message will stay here until the software is in a usable state.

What is Pigion?
---------------

Pigion is a an app that allows you to quickly and easily share files with anyone.

Why?
----

We share stuff with each other all the time. The other day, I took so many screenshots that people thought the paparazzi had finally found out about my juggling skills. 

Uhh, have you heard of Dropbox, man?
------------------------------------

~~Dropbox isn't cool, you know what's cool? A billion~~ Dropbox is pretty sweet, but they aren't a direct competitor right now. In fact, you can even use [Dropbox and Pigion](#I could use my Dropbox instead of hosting it on my own S3) together. 

#### Without Pigion, this is how I accomplish sharing things:

1. Create file  - take screenshot, write script, upload a photo from your camera, etc.
2. Open web browser and go to [Imgur](http://www.imgur.com) for images or [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) for everything else.
3. Get the link that I can send to people, either by clicking on the image in Imgur and then copying the URL or right clicking the file in Dropbox and clicking share.
4. Now that I have a link to that file, I can paste it anywhere I want - instant messaging, email, [Yammer](http://www.yammer.com), Twitter, etc.

#### With Pigion, that workflow looks like this:

1. Create file  - take screenshot, write script, upload a photo from your camera, etc.
2. Press the Cloud Copy keymap, currently Ctrl + Shift + C.
3. Now that I have a link to that file, I can paste it anywhere I want - instant messaging, email, [Yammer](http://www.yammer.com), Twitter, etc.

Ctrl + Shift + C puts a link to any file you have locally on your clipboard that you can then paste in an email or IM, iMessage, ChatRoulette window, or anywhere else your heart desires.

This is cool, but I would only use it if...
-------------------------------------------

###...I could password protect the files
>You can.

###...I could make the file available for only a short amount of time
>You can.

###...I could use my Dropbox instead of hosting it on my own S3
>You can.

###...I could use my Google Drive instead of hosting it on my own S3
>You can.

###...there was a quick way to generate a link to Rick Astly's Never Gonna Give You Up
>Go away.


Active development
------------------

As I stated before, this project is in active development. This README was the first thing I created. 

If this is the only file in the repo and the last commit was over 3 months ago, I probably abandoned it and forgot about it. Sorry.
